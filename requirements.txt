Some of the striking features of the platform include â€“
 1. A recommendation system for the MR which will recommend him as to where 
to reach out with his product. The machine will make this recommendation based on the previous sales figures by analysing 
them using machine learning algorithms. 
2. The portal will act as a platform for storage for all the marketing material like 
brochures, flyers etc. which in current day scenario the MR roams around carrying in his bag. 
3. The portal also houses a review 
system wherein the MR can take review for a medicine from a doctor and then a sentiment analysis can be performed on the 
review data collected. 
4. MedPad will also have a video conferencing feature with which the MR can video conference with a 
doctor located in some remote location, where reaching otherwise is not feasible. This is supposed to be the most striking 
feature of the platform since it has the potential of garnering prescriptions from locations where no other companies have 
reached and also people in that region are in a need of proper medication, but cannot attain the same due to the remoteness of 
the location.
